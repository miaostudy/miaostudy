# 🐾 My Purr-fect Meow-sonal Profile 🐾
Hi there hooman! 🐱

I'm a First-year grad furball~.

## 🧠 My Meow-jor Focus: Computer Vision!
I study computer vision—teaching computers to “see” like us kitties do.

Here’s what I’m currently paw-ing at:

1. Paw-some Image Making 🎨: I teach computers to **“draw”** new pics—like making fake sunbeam spots to nap in, or extra fluffy cat portraits! It’s like digital yarn—endless fun to play with, meow!
2. Fixing Blurry Med-Pics 🏥: Ever squinted at a fuzzy photo of a bug (or a medical scan)? I help clean up blurry “med images” so they’re sharp—like wiping paw prints off a window! Important for hoomans’ work, but also… sharp pics = better napping spot scouting.
3. Shrinking Big Data Piles 🗂️: Datasets are like giant piles of cat toys—fun, but way too big to carry! I “squish” them smaller (without losing the good stuff) so computers can play with them faster. Less waiting, more coding… and napping. Win-win, meow-meow!

If you love cats, code, or napping—let’s be friends! Send me a meow anytime. 😺💌
P.S. If you bring tuna, I’ll share my best “squish data” tips. Deal? 🐟
