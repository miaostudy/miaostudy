# <center>🐾 My Purr-fect Meow-sonal Profile 🐾
<center>Hi there hooman! 🐱

I'm a First-year grad furball ~.

## 💌 My Meow-jor Focus: Computer Vision!💌
I study **computer vision**—teaching computers to “see” like us kitties do.

**Here’s what I’m currently paw-ing at**

Paw-some Image Making: I teach computers to **“draw”** new pics. It’s like digital yarn—endless fun to play with, meow!

Fixing Blurry Med-Pics: I help clean up blurry **“med images”** so they’re sharp—like wiping paw prints off a window!

Shrinking Big Data Piles:  I **“squish datasets”** smaller (without losing the good stuff) so computers can play with them faster. Less waiting, more coding… and napping. Win-win, meow-meow!

If you love cats, code, or napping—let’s be friends! Send me a meow anytime.
