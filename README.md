# 🐾 My Purr-fect Meow-sonal Profile 🐾
Hi there hooman! 🐱

I'm a First-year grad furball~.

## 🧠 My Meow-jor Focus: Computer Vision!
I study computer vision—teaching computers to “see” like us kitties do.

Here’s what I’m currently paw-ing at:

1. Paw-some Image Making: I teach computers to **“draw”** new pics. It’s like digital yarn—endless fun to play with, meow!
2. Fixing Blurry Med-Pics: I help clean up blurry **“med images”** so they’re sharp—like wiping paw prints off a window!
3. Shrinking Big Data Piles:  I **“squish datasets”** smaller (without losing the good stuff) so computers can play with them faster. Less waiting, more coding… and napping. Win-win, meow-meow!

If you love cats, code, or napping—let’s be friends! Send me a meow anytime. 💌
